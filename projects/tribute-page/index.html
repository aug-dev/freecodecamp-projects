        <p>Akira Toriyama is one of the main creators responsible for the worlwide
          popularization of anime and manga.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is most known for his works <em>Dr. Slump</em> and <em>Dragon Ball</em>,
          but he is also the creator to a huge number of one-shots published
          on the <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though "genius" is a word frequently used to describe Toriyama, it
          seems that he himself didn't agree with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting things to me about him is the fact that he
          wast not an immediate success. In fact, it took him many iterations to
          really get things going.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you happen to be a fan of his works, I strongly encourage you to read
          more about him on his
